# Shield Standard


Each shield "standard" establishes a consistent physical layout for interconnection (the location of each pin) and pin purpose (power, general IO, data, etc...)

This allows for easy integration and compatibility between different <Term name="Shield"/>s and <Term name="Controller"/>s that adhere to the same standard.

While the LCPF currently only supports the [D1 Mini](D1Mini.mdx) shield standard, it is designed to be extensible to support other shield standards in the future. 

Other Shield Standards which LCPF may support in the future include:

  - <Term name="Feather"/> - Adafruit's Feather / FeatherWing standard (Also SparkFun THING+)
  - <Term name="Xiao"/> - SeeedStudio's Xiao boards (also Adafruit QTPy) standard
  - <Term name="PiPico"/> - Pi Pico
