# Units

A <Term name="Unit"/> gives meaning and scale to numeric values.

There are a lot of "numbers" moving around in LCPF.    What does 5 mean?  How
about -0.3? Confusion arises when we don't have a clear understanding of the units involved.

While there are limitations on how well LCPF can "enforce" proper use of units,
it does try and help as much as possible.


There's more documentation coming on Units, as this is a fairly important 
concept.  For now, here is a quick overview of the key unit types:

| Name | Represents | In | Python type | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | -- | -- |
| ZeroToOne | scaled value | fraction of 1 | float | a value between 0.0 and 1.0 inclusive | |
| PlusMinusOne | scaled value | +/- fraction of 1 | float | a value between -1.0 and 1.0 inclusive | |
| TimeInNS | time | nanoseconds |int | Time in nanoseconds | |
| TimeSpanInNS | time span | nanoseconds | int | Time span in nanoseconds | |
| TimeInMS | time | milliseconds | int | Time in milliseconds | |
| TimeSpanInMS | time span | milliseconds | int | Time span in milliseconds | |
| TimeInSeconds | time | seconds | float | Time in seconds | |
| TimeSpanInSeconds | time span | seconds | float | Time span in seconds | |
| DegreesPerSecond | rotation speed | degrees per second | float | rotation speed in degrees per second | |
| Degrees | angle | degrees | float | angle in degrees | |
| Millimeters | length | millimeters | float | length in millimeters | |
| Volts | voltage | volts | float | voltage in volts | |
| Hertz | frequency | cycles per second | float | frequency in cycles per second | |


Hopefully, most of these are fairly self explanatory, although more 
details will be added.   The two which might not be obvious, but 
are _very_ useful to understand are:

 - ZeroToOne
   - a scaled value between 0.0 and 1.0 inclusive.
   - It is often used for things like
     - brightness, where 0.0 is off and 1.0 is full brightness.
     - volume, where 0.0 is mute and 1.0 is full volume.
     - RGB color channel values
        - 0.0/0.0/0.0 is black
        - 1.0/1.0/1.0 is white
 - PlusMinusOne
   - a scaled value between -1.0 and 1.0 inclusive.
   - It is used for things like
     - speed control,  where -1.0 is full reverse, 0.0 is stopped, and 1.0 is full forward.

The use of 0.0 to 1.0 or -1.0 to 1.0 is very intenional, and used
 to normalize values and make them easier to work with.  There are 
 many examples of various devices which typically require you to "know" about 
 specific ranges.  For example, NeoPixels typically use 0-255 for
 each color channel.  Servo and motor controllers often use things 
 like duty cycles and PWM frequencies which you have to take into 
 account.   The LCPF hides those details as much as possible, and
 the ZeroToOne/PlusMinusOne unit types are a major part of that.
