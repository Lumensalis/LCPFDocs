# Controller

A <Term name="Controller"/> (in the context of the LCPF) is an embedded controller
running  device that uses <Term name="Devices"/>s to sense things in around it and 
produce effects which change over time.

## Practical details

LCPF is not intended to support any and every embedded controller out there. The LCPF 
has a specific [list of supported Controllers](../../Hardware/SupportedHardware.mdx#supported-controllers), and only contollers on that list will 
give you the full benefit of the LCPF.   Adding support for new controllers is not
necessarily difficult (for the LCPF development team) - it _can_ be a matter of
minutes to "configure" support,  but actually testing and making sure that a new 
controller works as expected might take a while.


There are a number of requirements that a new controller must meet to be
considered for LCPF support:

 - It must have active CurrentPython support
   - LCPF is built on CircuitPython, so this is a must
 - It must have sufficient resources (CPU, RAM, Flash) to run the LCPF.  While the
 minimums are still being determined, and _may_ vary depending between 
 different boards, the following guidelines will likely apply:
   - 2MB Minimum RAM (some of which may be PSRAM).  
     - Unfortunately this rules out a lot of the available CircuitPython boards
     - Reducing that to around 512MB, which is about the max for most types 
of board without PSRAM, is probably not going to happen. Doing so could make it 
fairly easy to set up a project that runs out of RAM - especially with WiFi/WebUI suppport
 - It should support a <Term name="ShieldStandard"/>
   - While not absolutely required, this greatly increases the flexibility and 
options available to LCPF users for a Controller. 

## Examples

- <Term name="Pattern"/>s which control LEDs
- <Term name="Motion"/>s which control movement
