# I/O Data Types

LCPF defines a set of data types that can be used for inputs and outputs. 
These data types are used to specify the kinds of values that can be sent or received by an input or output.

## Supported Data Types

There are a few basic categories of data types, some with further refinement

### **Boolean**
 Represents a simple choice between two options, such as
  - on or off 
  - true or false
  - 0 or 1

### **Color**
Represents a color value, typically used for RGB LEDs or similar devices.


### **Numeric**
Represents a numeric value. Used for analog inputs/outputs (e.g.,
 sensor readings, motor speeds). Number value types can be further refined with
  
  - **Range**: value should be within a specified range.  Ranges can be
    - Unbounded: the value can be outside the range
    - Limited: the value will always be within the range
    - Wrapping: the value wraps around when it exceeds the range limits

  - **Unit**
    - An IODataType may have a specific associated unit, for example
      an Input providing a distance may use millimeters as it's Unit

 Numeric IODataType

  - **ZeroToOne**: A value between zero and one


## Needed Types
[TODO:]
This is a temporary section to describe different potential uses for 
IODataTypes types that are not yet defined.

  - angle with continuous rotation 
    - radar dish, windmill, ...
  - angle/position within fixed range
    - door/gate
    - steering
  - level within fixed range  
    - volume
    - brightness
    - speed
  - scaling factors
  - temporal
    - duration
    - acceleration
