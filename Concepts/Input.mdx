# Input concept

Think of <Term name="Input"/>s like senses - taste, touch, sight, hearing... they are 
channels of incoming information about the environment in which your 
project operates.  Practical examples include
  - Switches and buttons
  - positional sensors - like volume knobs
  - proximity/distance sensors
  - light sensors
  - IR/RF remote controls

Inputs are often, but not always, associated with a physical electronic 
component.  LCPF also supports "virtual" inputs such as
  - DMX (Art-Net) device emulation
  - Web page controls [^2]
  - Mesh connections to other LCPF projects [^3]

  
[^2]: Partially implemented
[^3]: Not implemented yet, but coming soon

An input is source for incoming change.
