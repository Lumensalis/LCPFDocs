# Shield

A <Term name="Shield"/> is a board compatible with a [shield standard](../../Hardware/ShieldStandards), which allows it to be connected (usually via pin headers)  to <Term name="Controllers"/>s supporting the same standard. 

For example, the [Lolin S2 Mini](<www.wemos.cc/en/latest/s2/s2_mini.html>) <Term name="Controller"/> supports the  [D1 Mini shield layout](<https://www.wemos.cc/en/latest/d1/d1_mini.html>), so any "D1 Mini compatible" shield can be used with it. 

While the LCPF currently only supports "D1 Mini compatible" shields, 

It usually represents some hardware component either included on
 or connected to the <Term name="Controller"/>.
