see <Term name="Panel"/>

## Control Panel

A Control Panel is a collection of [Controls](PanelControl) and [Monitors](PanelMonitor) which 
createe an "interface" for remotely controlling and monitoring your project.

This currently allows the LCPF to support a browser/web interface.  In the future, it might support things like:
  - setting up optional knobs, buttons, etc with a display
  - having one project "control" another project over WiFi
  - creating a web interface for managing multiple projects at once, with synchronized effects
