# How-To NeoPixels


## Setup the Lights

First, you need light sources.  In this example, we'll get two NeoPixel chains
```python
neoPixA = caernarfon.pixels 
neoPixB = caernarfon.initNeoPixOnServo(3,neoPixelCount=35)
```
Next, you setup up groups within your light sources to match the physical layout of your LED chains
```python
firstTwoOnPixA       = neoPixA.nextNLights(2)  # this will be leds 0 and 1 on the neoPixA chain
leftStoneLights      = neoPixA.ring(3) # this will be the next three : 2-4
centerStoneLights    = neoPixA.ring(7) # this will be the next seven : 5-11

sceneIndicatorLights = neoPixB.stick(8) # this will be leds 0-7 the neoPixB chain
angleGaugeLights     = neoPixB.ring(12) # this will be leds 8-19 onneoPixB
```
