# Caernarfon Castle

[TerrainTronic Caernarfon Castle](https://github.com/Audio-Rochey/Terrain-Tronics-Caernarfon-Castle/) shield 

To use a Caernarfon Castle :

```python
caernarfon = main.TerrainTronics.addCaernarfon( neoPixelCount=45 )
```
 Adjust **neoPixelCount** to the number of LEDS on your chain connected to the Caernarfon's Neopixel output connection

 ## Servos / more NeoPixel chains

 The Caernarfon Castle has three "servo" connections - 1, 2, and 3.  Each of these can be used by LCPF for either a sevro _or_ an additional NeoPixel chain.  
   - use as servo :  caernarfon.**initServo( _servoNumber_ )** 
   - use as neopixels : caernarfon.**initNeoPixOnServo(_servoNumber_,neoPixelCount=_N_)**
   
## IR remote
to setup the IR Remote, use

 ```python 
ir = caernarfon.addIrRemote()     
```
