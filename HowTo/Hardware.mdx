# How-To Hardware

There's not much you can do to make interesting effects without hardware.  You need things which can light up, move, etc.  LCPF provides a way to describe what hardware you are using, to make it available fore your effects.


## Shields 

Shields are boards which "stack" on your controller.  They are typically accessed through a factory.  For example, to add a [TerrainTronic Caernarfon Castle](../Caernarfon) shield, you can use the **TerrainTronics** factory:
```python
caernarfon = main.TerrainTronics.addCaernarfon( neoPixelCount=45 )
```

Currently, the LCPF supports D1 Mini style shields, but that may expand in the future.  Possible additions include
  - [Adafruit FeatherWings](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather/featherwings)
  - Arduino Shields
  - [M5Stack](https://m5stack.com/)
  - ...
  

## StemmqQT / Qwiic
The [StemmaQT](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-adafruit-stemma-qt/what-is-stemma-qt)/[Qwiic](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) system for I2C offers a wide variety of devices which can be quite useful for effects.   See [supported devices](../../Hardware/StemmaQTQwiic/Devices) for information on devices you can use in your project.
