# Simple Start

Here we build up an example, step by step, to demonstrate various ways to use the LCPF.
Note that each section of code assumes that it follows some or all of the _earlier_ sections. 

## In The Beginning... [#beginning]

You need a <Term name="MainManager"/> to get started.  The LCPF has some helpful shortcuts like **LumensalisCP.Simple** for basic projects, which provides easy access to a wide variety of LCPF features, including getting the <Term name="MainManager"/>.  


```python
from LumensalisCP.Simple import *

main = ProjectManager()
```



## Add some hardware
Here we add a [TerrainTronic Caernarfon Castle](https://github.com/Audio-Rochey/Terrain-Tronics-Caernarfon-Castle/) shield 
```python
caernarfon = main.TerrainTronics.addCaernarfon( neoPixelCount=45 )
neoPixA = caernarfon.pixels 

```

## Setup the Lights

First, you need light sources.  In this example, we'll get two NeoPixel chains
```python
neoPixA = caernarfon.pixels 
neoPixB = caernarfon.initNeoPixOnServo(3,neoPixelCount=35)
```
Next, you setup up groups within your light sources to match the physical layout of your LED chains
```python
firstTwoOnPixA       = neoPixA.nextNLights(2)  # this will be leds 0 and 1 on the neoPixA chain
leftStoneLights      = neoPixA.ring(3) # this will be the next three : 2-4
centerStoneLights    = neoPixA.ring(7) # this will be the next seven : 5-11

sceneIndicatorLights = neoPixB.stick(8) # this will be leds 0-7 the neoPixB chain
angleGaugeLights     = neoPixB.ring(12) # this will be leds 8-19 onneoPixB
```
