# Lumensalis CircuitPython Framework Documentation

This is the user guide and documentation for the 
Lumensalis CircuitPython Framework (LCPF).

## Overview

Before you can use the LCPF, you need to get it installed and working on 
a supported embedded controller - see the [Getting Started](./GettingStarted/) section.

Once it's installed, to use the LCPF for your project you need to
  - configure the [Hardware](Hardware) you're using 
  - configure the behaviors you want your project to use

### Configuring the Hardware
If you're using "shield" style expansion boards (like TerrainTronics D1 Mini
Castles), configuring the hardware is fairly easy (_much_ easier thant it 
would be with most other systems). See the [Device Configuration](Hardware/DeviceConfiguration) section for details.
  
### Configuring the Behaviors

The LCPF provides a set of behaviors that you can use to add effects to your project.
There are two main approaches to doing this:

  - Find Example code, copy and customize it
    - this is the easiest way to get started
      - IF there's an example 
     that does something similar to  you want
      - there will be more examples coming soon
  - Learn all about the [Concepts](Concepts) and [Behaviors](Behaviors) in
  the LCPF and define your project behaviors from scratch
    - this allows you to get the most out of the LCPF
    - but it does require a bit more work

Starting by finding and copying example code is the recommended approach for
 most users.  Before long, you'll start understanding a bit about 
 key [Concept](Concepts)s like [Scenes](Concepts/Scene) and key [Behaviors](Behaviors) 
 like [Patterns](Behaviors/Pattern) and [Motions](Behaviors/Motion)
 from the examples.
