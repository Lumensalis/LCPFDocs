# Quirks

This section contains information about various interactions 
between CircuitPython and LCPF.  These are not flaws in CircuitPython,
but rather limitations and trade-offs imposed on the LCPF's goal of simplifying 
things which might have been easier to implement in full, recent CPython systems.
Assuming you could actually get full CPython running on a microcontroller ... 
there are some good reasons why CircuitPython doesn't try and replicate all of CPython's features.


## Object / function scope


## Things CircuitPython does not support

  - `__all__ = ["a","b"]` for restricting results of `from someModule import *`
  - `__set_name__` for descriptors
  - `__slots__`
  - standard modules : **inspect**, **typing**, **importlib**
  - stack access (like `inspect.currentframe()`)
  - setting ***\__name\__*** on function / method / closure(lambda) instances
  - no way to reload a .mpy file?
