# StemmaQt / Qwiic

The StemmaQT (from Adafruit) and Qwiic (from SparkFun) standards are a compatible system
 for easily connecting <Term name="Device"/>s to a <Term name="Controller"/> using I2C.   They use a common 4 pin JST PH connector

 There are a wide variety of StemmaQT and Qwiic devices which can be quite useful for effects.    See [supported devices](../../Hardware/StemmaQTQwiic/Devices) for information on devices you can use in your project.
