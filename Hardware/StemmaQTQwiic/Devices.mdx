# Supported StemmaQt / Qwiic Devices 

These are devices which the LCPF currently supports

### Adafruit
  - [AW9523 GPIO Expander](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4886)  - great for genereal simple I/O (buttons, switches) and LEDS
  - [TLV493D Triple-Axis Magnetometer](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4366)
  - [MPR121 12-Key Capacitive Touch Sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1982) - add "stealth" buttons to your project
  - [Wii Nunchuk adapter](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4836)
  - [PCA9685 16-Channel 12-bit PWM/Servo Driver](https://www.adafruit.com/product/815) -control lots of servo motors
  - [QtRotaryEncoder](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5880)
  - [VL53L0X](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5425)
  - ... More will be coming 
    - adding support for other Adafruit StemmaQT devices is usually a quick process 
      - for the LCPF developers[^1]
    

### Sparkfun
  - There are no Sparkfun brand Qwiic devices currently supported, but they also could be added



### NOT SUPPORTED YET - but may be before long
These are devices that may get support in LCPF soon.  Most are ones I already have and have used for other projects, ust haven't gotten around to adding LCPF support for them yet.
