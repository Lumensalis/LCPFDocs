# Supported Hardware

In order to use all the nifty hardware that provides Inputs and/or Outputs, 
LCPF needs to know what hardware you are using.  This is usually a fairly
complex part of an embedded project.  LCPF makes this much easier[^5].  For example, if you
use a [Lolin S2 Mini](https://www.wemos.cc/en/latest/s2/s2_mini.html) with a 
[Terrain-Tronics Caernarfon Castle Kit](https://www.tindie.com/products/terraintronics/caernarfon-castle-kit/), 
 IR remote,  35 NeoPixel LEDS, and two servo motors,  your entire code for device configuration could be
as simple as 
```python 
    caernarfon = mainManager.TerrainTronics.addCaernarfon(neoPixelCount=35)
    doorMotor = caernarfon.initServo( 1, "doorDrive" )
    windowMotor = caernarfon.initServo( 2, "windowMotor" )
    remote = caernarfon.addIrRemote()
```
No pins assignments, no addresses, no board types - LCPF handles all that for you.[^5]
For example, if you
use a [Lolin S2 Mini](https://www.wemos.cc/en/latest/s2/s2_mini.html) with a 
[Terrain-Tronics Caernarfon Castle Kit](https://www.tindie.com/products/terraintronics/caernarfon-castle-kit/), 
configuration is as simple as 
```python 
caernarfon = mainManager.TerrainTronics.addCaernarfon()
```
There's no need what kind of controller you're 
running on [^3] - LCPF figures that out for you.  And since it knows where the 
various parts of the Caernarfon Castle board are connected, there's no need
to specify pin assignments.  So if you are using the IR remote,  35 NeoPixel 
LEDS, and two servo motors,  your entire code for device configuration could be
```python 
    caernarfon = mainManager.TerrainTronics.addCaernarfon(neoPixelCount=35)
    doorMotor = caernarfon.initServo( 1, "doorDrive" )
    windowMotor = caernarfon.initServo( 2, "windowMotor" )
    remote = caernarfon.addIrRemote()

```


[^1]: D1MPC = D1 Mini Pin Compatible, accepts Wemos Mini shields (like Terrain-Tronics Castle boards)
[^3]: Currently supported controllers include Lolin S2 Mini, Lolin S3 Mini, and the Lilygo T-OI Plus
[^5]: _IF_ you  stick within the "curated" set of hardware options.  However, there are already a few dozen supported devices and the list continues to grow.
