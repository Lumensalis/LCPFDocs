Unless you want to delve deep into the internal plumbing (and you _know_ what flows 
through plumbing) you'd best stay away from this section. 
  - It will go into some fairly advanced design concepts, tactics, and strategies 
    - which can be very powerful if used correctly
    - which often do NOT play well with more common methodologies
      - mixing them improperly can cause more harm than good
  - It is only intended to be useful for those working "under the hoods" to enhance and extend the LCPF
    - partly for organizing my own thoughts 
    - it will not be as thorough or complete as other areas of documentation
      - will NOT be enough - at least for a while - even for most experienced 
      developers to fully understand how and why things are done internally 

So if you're still reading, on your head be it.   PM me on the Lumensalis Discord 
and I'll add you to the hidden "#internals" channel.


These pages discuss technical design issues related to various 
concepts within the LCPF.
