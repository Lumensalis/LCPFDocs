The [Caernarfon Castle](https://github.com/Audio-Rochey/Terrain-Tronics-Caernarfon-Castle) board is already set up to support a NeoPixel chain.   You'll need a connection from the [Caernarfon Castle](https://github.com/Audio-Rochey/Terrain-Tronics-Caernarfon-Castle) to the start of your NeoPixel chain, and between each NeoPixel LED or strip.
