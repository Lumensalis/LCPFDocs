# Soldering

You don't need fancy soldering skills. If you can use hot glue with foam core board you'll be fine

You will need
  - a soldering iron
  - solder
  - tip cleaner
  - and rosin/flux
  Doesn't need to be fancy, a [cheap soldering iron kit](https://www.amazon.com/Soldering-Interchangeable-Adjustable-Temperature-Enthusiast/dp/B087767KNW) from Amazon with good ratings with everything above should be fine
