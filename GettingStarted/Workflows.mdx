# Workflows

## Setup a supported editor

WARNING: Not all editors work well for CircuitPython[^editors]. Starting with Mu or Thonny is ***highly recommended*** unless you are already familiar with Python, USB serial device access, and ESP32 development or VSCode.

- [Mu](https://codewith.mu/en/)
  - Python editor for beginners with [CircuitPython support](https://codewith.mu/en/tutorials/1.2/adafruit)
- [Thonny](https://thonny.org/) 
  - more flexible than Mu, less complicated than VSCode
  - under Tools / Options / Interpreter select ```CircuitPython (generic)```
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 
  - more complicated IDE, works well if you're already familiar with VSCode
  - useful extensions
    - [CircuitPython v2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wmerkens.vscode-circuitpython-v2)
    - [Serial Monitor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-serial-monitor)


## Setup a USB serial console interface

You need the ability to see console text output (error messages, print statements, ...) from your controller.  The editors listed above (with proper configuration / extensions) already have this built in.  Otherwise, you need a terminal program that can connect to a USB serial device. 

## Notes

[^safeMode]:  Technically it isn't ___always___ run - if the code in your controller crashes, it can go into "safe mode" which causes it to skip loading code.py on the next reset.running on

[^editors]: Not all editors save files "properly" when using a USB device.  Files can get partially written and/or take a while before the changes are actually written to the drive. See [Adafruit's Recommended Editors](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/recommended-editors) for more details.
